# FinTech Project1 - Cryptara, the friendly Robo Advisor that helps investors make effective investment decisions in the Crypto Market.

## Installation
### The following libraries are required to run Cryptara:
    1. TVDATAFEED
    pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir git+https://github.com/StreamAlpha/tvdatafeed.git
    2. TAHandler
    pip install tradingview-ta
    
## Trading View API runs on separate Python libraries then the Pyviz environment, thus two separate environments are needed to run the Roboadvisor and Visualization scripts. Additional information is below:

### cryptara_roboadvisor_final_STEP 1 - This is step 1 which will analyze and select the best performing Cryptos, and extract data to csv files for step 2 (visualization)
    Note: You must be connected through TVDataFeed websocket and TAHandler API to 
    run this file.
### cryptara_results_visualization_STEP 2- This script will run visualization models on the data extracted in Step 1. Ultimately an interactive dashboard is created to help support the reasoning behind Crytptara's selections.  
    Note: You must run all visualization dashboards in your Pyviz environment.
